Well I'm trying not to be closed Without leaving myself open
It's like everything I've known has been intentionally broken
And it truly feels like the summer's arrived again
Well I guess it's time to pretend
I need one more try
Give me one more chance
I would rather die than compromise
Well I don't know what's going on
It can't seem to find the words
Maybe I'm going wrong
Or maybe something worse
I'm overusing it
Confusing it
And I just can't shake the feeling I'm losing it
Maybe I just can't be trusted
I know, you know
There's nothing else left so I'll go
And maybe you'll be fine in time my dear
So take it
I hate it
I got to put it back but it won't fit
And not everything I need is right here
